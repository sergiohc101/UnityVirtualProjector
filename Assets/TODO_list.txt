>>> Implement scale for projected QUAD

>>> Implement lookat vector for camera (currently always origin)

>>> Make possible to input the Camera Extrinsics into the scene

>>> Separate the line renderer to a different class
    (the linerenderer gameobjects should be nested somewhere)

>>> Make possible to handle SVG files for the line renderer (some code already exists)

>>> Implement the multi plane logic!
    (this shall detect when a projected point is outside the plane limit, 
    find the nearest point in the plane & handle plane overlaping!)

>>> Implement export mechanism to get an output file with the plane points ready for tracing

>>> (OPT) Investigate how to overlap the camera picture on the scene
