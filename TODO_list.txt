# [!] ...better migrate this list to some other github feature request tool

>>> Remove scale from plane/cube transforms
>>> Handle shape plane discontinuity
>>> Implement export mechanism to get an output file with the plane points ready for tracing in planes (handle shape discontinuity)

>>> Make possible to handle SVG files for the line renderer (some code already exists)
    (Where to handle the svg shape logic ?? )
    -- (How to handle several instances for the lineRenderers ?? ) -> DONE

 >> Make possible to input the Camera Extrinsics into the scene (check if its worth to input the rotation matrix) <- no way!


// Done
>>> Implement scale for projected QUAD
>>> Implement lookat vector for camera (currently always origin)
>>> Separate the line renderer to a different class
    (the linerenderer gameobjects should be nested somewhere)
>>> Investigate how to overlap the camera picture on the scene

>>> Implement the multi plane logic!
    (this shall detect when a projected point is outside the plane limit, 
    find the nearest point in the plane & handle plane overlaping!)
